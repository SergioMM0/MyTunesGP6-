Read before:

1. All functions requested are fully implemented and "out" of bugs
except the Search song field which I couldn't finish because of time.

2. This project started as a group project but due to laziness of my
groupmates / lack of interest / personal reasons nobody gave to me...
I got forced to do it on my own. (Evidences can be given if requested)
All commits and it's content can be followed if needed having a look
on GitHub where the directory of the project on "Insights".

3. Methods are commented on their respective interfaces for BLL and
DAL. GUI is commented straight up over the method name or variable
when needed.

4. DBDAO is commented on respective interfaces.

5. Thanks to Nedas when help was required. @Metallist1 on GitHub.
